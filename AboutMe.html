<h1>HERE'S A LITTLE ABOUT ME</h1>
 <p> Hi I'm Tatiana Sampson, currently a junior in college and I have a passion for art! Though I may not draw as much as I used to because my life has been hetic coming to college I still get to find the time to relax and get my hand a little dirty :) </p>
 <p> It was always my dream to run my own shop and sell my art so I figured with my new interest in having a career with website development I figured why not create a website for my future shop.</p>
 <p> This whole website is sort of like a prototype for what could be in the future.I hope you enjoyed it!</p>
